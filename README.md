# Go Full Goblin

#### *"Fuel your trolling with a drink"*

### Deployed Site

https://kyleschop.github.io/go-full-goblin/

### Description
This application was designed for goblins looking to create cocktails in the comfort of their cave.

### Usage
When an internet troll is feeling especially thirsty & would like a recipe for some liquid courage, they can quickly & easily utilize this application to make a fresh drink. Unlike most online recipe resources, this site does not include any malarkey. It's short, sweet & to the point. The slovenly elf searches for a key word related to their desired poison. A recipe then appears in the center of the application. If the cocktail shown isn't of their heart's desire in that exact moment, they can continue their search. All drinks are stored in "The Cave" on the left hand side for future use. The right site of the application has ad space available, but only for vendors that are promoting the comforts of depravity.

Go out for a drink? No need. "Go Full Goblin" at home ðŸ§Œ
